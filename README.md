# Surgex

***All Things Elixir @ Surge Ventures***

This is the official entry point and hub for all company-wide Elixir efforts at Surge Ventures.
Here's what you can expect to find in the
[Surgex repository](https://github.com/surgeventures/surgex).

## Surgex bundle

Surgex is a package of cross-project helper modules, each too small or too young to justify
publishing them separately. It currently consists of:

- `Surgex.Config`
- `Surgex.Sentry`

## Separate packages

Besides the toolbelt bundle inside the Surgex package, we also maintain separate Elixir packages
that contain our bigger and more serious open source efforts. Currently, we own the following repos:

- [Jabbax](https://github.com/surgeventures/jabbax) - JSON API Building Blocks Assembly for Elixir

## Elixir knowledge base

Here, we'll maintain Elixir and Phoenix style guides, hints and FAQs to empower our in-house Elixir
community and culture.

*Coming Soonâ„¢*.
